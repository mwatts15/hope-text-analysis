<p>Forget about network perimeters - an organization&#39;s real attack surface is made up of which codebases can be interacted with or altered. This talk explores the past history and the methods available for maliciously altering codebases and it even includes how an attacker can bring their code into your organization without even touching your perimeter. Topics covered include everything from conceptualizing an attack path to the execution of it; including obtaining relevant target information, exploiting the human element, writing plausibly deniable vulnerable source code, and backdooring binaries.</p>

Furthermore, the technology needed to hack biology is becoming much more accessible. In this panel, you&#39;ll learn some of the basics of biology using terms and analogies that would be useful for hackers and for people in information technology. Basic points will be outlined on how to get started in biohacking, both virtually and physically.

<p>While Edward Snowden has revealed a lot about the NSA&#39;s surveillance, our federal and local governments conduct a great deal of surveillance we still don&#39;t know about. We can begin to identify what that surveillance is by identifying the empty spaces - in criminal cases, in legislation, or timelines - where such surveillance must be. This talk will attempt to point to some of the black holes in our surveillance map, both ones we know exist and the places where one must exist. That&#39;s the first step in working collaboratively to expose that surveillance. More importantly, this talk will focus on how to see these black holes, and how people around the country can work together to make them visible again.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#Daniel C. Howe">Daniel C. Howe</a></strong></p>
<p>It has been a decade now since the release of TrackMeNot, the first privacy tool to leverage obfuscation for counter-surveillance. In the interim, obfuscation has been actively developed, with new tools exploring its use for email (ScareMail), location-tracking (CacheCloak), advertising (AdNauseam), DNA analysis (Invisible), and beyond. This talk reviews the development of the strategy and considers some of the questions it raises for the tool-making community. Daniel will debut AdNauseam 2.0, the first cross-platform production release of AdNauseam, which aims at nothing less than ending advertising-based surveillance as we know it. Obfuscation can be defined as the strategy of using noise to hide one&#39;s true interests and/or confuse an adversary. As obfuscation is relatively flexible in its use, it holds unique promise as a strategy for DIY privacy and security. TrackMeNot was the first privacy tool to leverage obfuscation online, protecting web searchers from search engine profiling by hiding their queries in a cloud of generated noise. AdNauseam directs similar techniques at the advertising networks that track users across the web, polluting user profiles and subverting the economic system that drives this pervasive form of surveillance.</p>

<p>Following the Snowden revelations and with the U.K. government&#39;s revival of the Snooper&#39;s Charter legislation, Gareth was one of many people who accepted the EFF Tor challenge. Unfortunately, many U.K. ISPs&#39; colocation providers do not appreciate Tor exits and, after several abruptly terminated servers, he decided to build his own privacy centric, non-profit ISP so he could operate Tor exits and offer Unix shells, etc. on his own terms. This talk explores the process of becoming a local Internet registry in Europe, dealing with RIR polices such as IPv4 exhaustion, Tor abuse complaints, and the deployment of a broadband product that only has a Tor bridge instead of a next hop at the end of a DSL connection.</p>

<p>CAPTCHAs are the most common form of web activity security and they play an important role in regulating online activity. CAPTCHAs keep bots and &quot;blackhats&quot; from abusing online resources by proving a user&#39;s humanity via solving a challenge that consists of a hard AI problem. CAPTCHA development is a constantly evolving arms race with new styles and designs being created by site administrators and broken by attackers every day. In order to keep the world wide web usable, site administrators must constantly work on developing new methods and improving CAPTCHAs to prevent automated abuse.
This talk will cover the basics of what CAPTCHAs are, what type of security they provide, the major types of CAPTCHAs, and how to attack them. The speakers will also discuss criteria used when designing their CAPTCHA framework and cover some academic literature that is relevant to the field. They will look at popular tools and services currently used to attack CAPTCHAs and provide some insight into the current state of bot identification.
A fresh new CAPTCHA design will be presented that uses human emotion recognition as the &quot;hard AI&quot; challenge. Speakers will demonstrate how they have achieved their desired usability, scalability, and robustness levels via a real world implementation. An overview of the tools and tool chain used (MS Emotion API, GIMP, Google APIs, Python, Django) to create the CAPTCHA challenges will be detailed. The session will conclude with a user study and provide an analysis of the results with a discussion about some of the limitations of the project.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#Ed Platt">Ed Platt</a></strong></p>
<p>Decentralized network architectures can protect against vulnerabilities not addressed by strong encryption. Encryption works well, but only when private keys can be kept secret and ciphertext can get to its destination intact. Encrypted messages can be surveilled by acquiring private keys (FBI and Lavabit/Apple), man-in-the-middle attacks (NSA QUANTUM), or censored by blocking communication entirely (Pakistan and YouTube). These attacks are difficult to protect against because they are social rather than technological. But they all have one thing in common: they require centralization. Censorship and man-in-the-middle attacks target communication bottlenecks and legal coercion targets a small number of legal entities. This talk will discuss decentralized approaches to attack tolerance, including ongoing original research.</p>

<p>There is increasing interest in the ability of companies like Facebook and Twitter to influence elections. What are the roles and responsibilities of these companies to be fair and impartial? Newspapers express bias and endorse candidates. Facebook employees have even asked if they have a responsibility to (try to) prevent Donald Trump from becoming elected. Twitter has been accused of censoring tweets supporting Donald Trump, while also allegedly censoring posts that were unfavorable to Hillary Clinton. While that is certainly legal, is it acceptable to us as citizens? If not, what can we do about it? And what makes our expectations of bias from Twitter different from our expectations of <em>The New York Times</em> or <em>The Daily News?</em>
This talk is an exploration of the ways that social media can influence elections, and what that means for us as citizens.</p>

<p>Chinese-made locks have traditionally had poor reputations. The Chinese-made locks that we usually encounter in our day-to-day lives always seem to be low quality, cheap, and insecure at best, so it may seem that this is all that the Chinese make. However, there is a whole other world of lock designs that are sold exclusively to the Chinese domestic market. In this presentation, a variety of different Chinese lock designs will be discussed, from the prominent and innovative, such as the Yuema free spinning cylinder line of locks to the relatively obscure, such as the Chinese take on the Corbin Emhart rotating pin design. This talk will cover the defeats of these locks, both theoretical and practical, in addition to the steps Chinese lock companies have taken to address these vulnerabilities, as well as the reasons behind the constant innovation.</p>

<p>Archiving web pages is hard. Crawling, images, assets... Javascript! But archiving code is not. It comes as content-addressed objects neatly packaged in repositories and tagged with refs. It compresses well. Changes can be detected in real time with the GitHub Firehose API.
Nevertheless, we need to do it today while the host is healthy, and not wait for it to start bundling adware or slowly fade away. Otherwise, in ten years we&#39;ll find ourselves running unreproducible binaries on Javascript emulators, or unable to build the software that could recover all our pictures because that one dependency is missing.
This is a talk about building The Code Archive, a Wayback Machine for git. Every time a repository changes on GitHub, Code Archive systems fetch it and archive all the files, commits, tags, and branches as they were at that time. Then you can clone a repository as it was at any point in time, even if the original has been rebased, has disappeared, or GitHub is down. There&#39;s a lot of fun to be had when (ab)using the git protocol to clone and pull millions of repositories to the same database. Speakers will show what git looks like on the wire and how fetches are optimized. Also, all the Go code powering the Archive is available... on GitHub.</p>

<p>This past May, in response to the growing sophistication of cyberattacks and application exploits, U.S. lawmakers (almost unanimously) passed the first-ever federal law concerning trade secret protection: the Defense of Trade Secrets Act. Under the DTSA, however, reverse engineering is protected and deemed 100 percent legal. Within weeks, the EU followed with their own directive increasing trade secret protection while protecting reverse engineering. This talk discusses how this new law impacts reverse engineering, the pros and cons of tying reverse engineering to the courts, best practices for code development, limitations on reverse engineering, counterattacks to those limitations, and counterattacks to the counterattacks.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#David Williams-King">David Williams-King</a></strong></p>
<p>Carpal tunnel and repetitive strain injuries can prevent programmers from typing for months at a time. Fortunately, it is possible to replace the keyboard with speech recognition - David writes Linux systems code by voice. The key is to develop a voice grammar customized for programming. A community has evolved around hacking the commercial Dragon NaturallySpeaking to use custom grammars, but this method suffers from fragmentation, a steep learning curve, and frustrating installation difficulties. In an attempt to make voice coding more accessible, David created a new speech recognition system called Silvius, built on open-source software with free speech models. It can run on cloud servers for ease of setup, or locally for the best latency. He and his collaborators have also prototyped a hardware dongle which types Silvius keystrokes using a fake USB keyboard, and requires no software installation.

The hope is that Silvius will lower the bar for experimentation and innovation, and encourage ordinary programmers to try voice coding, instead of waiting until a crippling injury throws them in at the deep end.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 1979 and bright young hackers are torturing their Commodore PETs and Apple IIs to make all the pagers beep on a university campus, or take control of a dam in Alberta. (Both are true stories - Tom was there.)
Fast forward to 2019 and their children (or grandchildren) are doing the same thing - driven by our universal desire to make technology &quot;do things it&#39;s not supposed to be able to do.&quot; Except now, the role of personal computers is being played by CRISPR Cas9 gene editing gear that they bought for a few dollars on eBay. What can they do with it? Make animals glow in the dark? Destroy all life on this planet? Hold us hostage with bio-ransomware?
This talk will examine the fast moving science behind biohacking and how it will change our lives. It will also apply the &quot;technocreep framework&quot; to predict which aspects of biohacking will be considered cool and which will seem creepy, even to the freethinking folks who attend HOPE. As a bonus, you&#39;ll learn what happens when you put sponges and electrodes on your head and run direct current through your brain.</p>

<p>We are still facing the same security vulnerabilities from over a decade ago. The problems are not going away anytime soon and a reason is because computer science curricula are still churning out students who are not even exposed to security. This talk will address the lack of emphasis on information security in computer science curricula, how CS curricula have an obligation, how to gradually fix the problem by integrating security into many computer science undergraduate and graduate classes, and success stories from students. This talk will also discuss what Tufts and Brandeis are currently working on to further address the security education problem by creating a joint cyber security and policy program that spans multiple departments. Additional points and feedback from the audience are encouraged to help with the issue.</p>

<p>For several years, law enforcement has been complaining that legal wiretaps are &quot;going dark&quot; (especially when encryption is used), and has been lobbying lawmakers to mandate &quot;surveillance-friendly&quot; technology that allows the government to break encryption and unlock devices under certain circumstances. At the same time, computer and network security is universally recognized to be in an increasingly dangerous state of peril, and technologists worry that &quot;backdoor&quot; mandates will only make things worse.
We&#39;ve been here before, not long ago. In the 1990s, after the government proposed the &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; key escrow system, we had a similar debate with similar stakes. It was finally resolved when the government essentially gave up and finally allowed cryptography to proliferate.
This talk will review the current cryptography debate, will examine the risks of the &quot;keys under doormats&quot; that the FBI is asking for, and will explore technical alternatives that could satisfy the needs of law enforcement without making computer security more of a mess than it already is. In particular, Matt and Sandy will examine the viability, and risks, of law enforcement exploitation of existing vulnerabilities in targets&#39; devices to obtain wiretap evidence.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is an established virtual currency well known for enabling affordable and efficient transfers of money between individuals and entities. With its market cap of over $7 billion and hundreds of thousands per day, the Bitcoin currency has become popular enough for offenders to be able to hide among its users when they purchase illicit goods and services online or need to receive extortion payments. The aims of this presentation are twofold. The first is to present an open-source tool developed by the panelists that analyzes all of the Bitcoin transactions and regroups Bitcoin addresses based on their incoming and outgoing transactions. This allows for a more accurate mapping of individuals&#39; online activities no matter how many Bitcoin addresses they are using. The tool, as well as a database of all nodes identified by the tool, will be released on the day of the conference. The second aim of this presentation is to provide real world use cases for the tool to better understand online illicit activities. To do so, David and Mathieu will present two case studies that will follow the evolution through time of the revenues generated by online illicit groups and the strategies they used to manage the incoming bitcoins. This talk will be of interest to attendees looking to better understand how the Bitcoin currency works and the attacks that can be used to de-anonymize Bitcoin users. A live demonstration will explain how the open-source tool works and the strategies that could be used to preserve one&#39;s anonymity in the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>When you work in IT or Infosec, it may feel like you&#39;re constantly fighting a battle to bring the non-technical people you work with up to speed on how technologies work. When you help family members with their computer problems, you may just want to throw up your hands and scream &quot;It&#39;s no use! They just don&#39;t get it!&quot; But when you dig a little deeper, as a number of studies have done, you find that the average person does have some knowledge about how the Internet works. They build on this knowledge every day - but sometimes they&#39;re incorporating what they&#39;ve learned from that scene on <em>NCIS</em> where two people are using a keyboard at once. They may hold some common misconceptions. Or they may be sooo close and just need one little additional piece of information.
Gus will share insights from the study she has been working on for the past year about average people&#39;s mental models of the Internet, along with a number of other studies from human-computer interaction and security research. Key concepts like &quot;mental models,&quot; &quot;fragile knowledge,&quot; &quot;stereotype threat,&quot; and &quot;learned helplessness&quot; will be explored. In addition, ways the gaps in people&#39;s knowledge impact digital security and how we might strategize on a large scale to help fill those gaps will be explored. You&#39;ll come away with better strategies for helping empower the non-technical folks in your life to solve their own problems.</p>

Since government agencies and schools require people to run software to exercise their rights, this software must all be free, but increasingly they impose use of nonfree software and commercial snooping services.

Eating healthy and exercising your mind and body sounds like a load of crap to a lot of hackers but the reality is that if you want to have a long sustained life that you can continue to use for hacking and exploration, you&#39;ll want to keep your mind and body healthy. Practicing concentration daily and learning to meditate can help you literally hack your mind, and help you make changes within yourself you might have thought impossible.

<p>In the two years since the Courage Foundation was launched, they have supported beneficiaries at every stage of the information exposure process: hacktivists, investigative journalists, and human rights defenders. Most recently, the Courage Foundation announced their campaign to raise European funds and awareness for Chelsea Manning. They believe the blurred line between activists and journalists needs to be embraced as a spectrum of solidarity; each of these actors needs the others to bring information to public attention, and so each deserve our support.
While whistleblowers like Edward Snowden enjoy international appreciation, hackers are often marginalized as outsiders who don&#39;t enact real change. But it&#39;s high time we recognized their value, understanding that - since the information war occurs largely online - digital activists are those that governments seek to make the biggest examples of.
In this session, the speakers will provide updates on their ongoing cases, including Barrett Brown&#39;s and Chelsea Manning&#39;s, discuss some of the systemic issues encountered along the way, and then solicit your input.

<p>Why are people still being left to die from treatable diseases when they can&#39;t afford the arbitrarily inflated prices of patent-protected medications? As hackers, we believe that when the infrastructure fails, we must have a way to fall back to DIY methods. Medicine should not be an exception to this. Pharmaceuticals are just chemicals, chemicals are made using chemistry, and chemistry can be automated. Come learn how anyone can make patent-protected medications at home using a new open-source automated chemical reaction chamber made from off-the-shelf parts. One no longer has to have a science background to do chemistry. We can save our own lives. Speakers will detail how the mechanism can be built, how it is programmed, and distribute the plans and programs live at the talk. The programs for drug synthesis and the design of the mechanism can be shared over any digital channel - and can be improved and modified by any end user. A highly controversial drug will be synthesized live on stage during the talk.</p>

Though no one is entirely sure, these questions invite both scientific and metaphorical approaches addressing these issues. Ellen will discuss the emergence of technologies, research, and methods on brain datatyping; privacy and its ethical implications; sending and receiving motor commands between two different brains; moving robotic prosthesis through thoughts; the formation of memory; manipulating memory via frequencies of light; and hacking brain computer interfaces (BCIs) to extract vital information.

This will bring dramatic ethnological and environmental impact to the South American Pampas.
Hackers can play an important role by developing easy to construct, recycled, upcycled, and DIY technology for the decentralized production of yerba mate in both traditional and new ways. This draws attention to the need for a solution for food sovereignty in the southern hemisphere.

<p>Recent events have reminded us again of the urgent need to make encryption ubiquitous on the Internet. Yet, with the exception of Transport Layer Security, encryption remains the domain of &quot;expert&quot; users.
Hope X (2014) was held in the immediate aftermath of the publication of the Snowden papers. In the two years since, there have been many important developments in the standards world (in particular, IEEE, IETF, W3C) that are designed to defeat mass surveillance. These efforts include randomized MAC addresses for Wi-Fi, Certificate Transparency, and DNS privacy.
This talk will review those efforts and provide a preview of the next generation of cryptographic applications currently being built. The PrismProof email system described at Hope X has become the core of the Mathematical Mesh, an infrastructure that solves the encryption usability problem. Once a device is connected to a user&#39;s Mesh profile, all the network application settings (including for OpenPGP, SSH, etc.) are managed automatically from an application controlled by the user.
Solving the usability problem and the current move to elliptic curve based cryptography allows Internet security to move beyond the limited cryptographic primitives used in TLS, SSH, and OpenPGP. Public key encryption offers more than just encryption and signatures. Future message encryption schemes will allow end-to-end secure communication within groups of users without the sender having to create decryption material for each intended recipient.</p>

<p>Tuning in distant foreign radio and television stations is a conduit to unique and exotic information. These signals are often confronting, uncensored, and unsanitized. In the western world, we blur or pixelate images of death and torture, but signals from war zones or rebellions show tragedies happening live on the air. Other signals broadcast the joy of life on this planet through exotic song, music, and film. Digital wide-band recordings of the electromagnetic spectrum allow virtual time travel, a form of mental teleportation whereby recorded spectrum is tuned to hear stations as if they were being tuned in real time. Take a virtual tour of Mark&#39;s monitoring station in Sydney, Australia which is wired to access the world&#39;s mass media via whatever delivery conduit is needed to capture the content. The station receives hundreds of thousands of inbound digital audio and video channels that let him monitor domestic radio and television from most parts of the world. If he wants to watch breakfast television from Tibet, or maybe the nightly news from the remote Pacific islands of Wallis and Futuna, then it&#39;s available in perfect studio quality.

<p>The wide adoption and the benefits of cloud computing has led many users and enterprises to move their applications and infrastructure towards the Cloud. However, the nature of the Cloud introduces new security challenges, therefore organizations are required to ensure that such hosted deployments do not expose them to additional risk. Auditing cloud services has become an essential task and, in order to carry out such assessments, familiarization with certain components of the target environments is required. This talk will provide insight into the Microsoft Azure Cloud service and present practical advice on performing security assessments on Azure-hosted deployments. More specifically, it will demystify the main components of a cloud service and dive further into Azure-specific features. The main security controls and configurations associated with each of the mainstream Azure components will also be explored. Areas that will be covered include role-based security, secure networking features, perimeter security, encryption capability, auditing, and monitoring of activities within the Azure Cloud environment. Additionally, the talk will include the demonstration of a new tool that uses the Azure PowerShell cmdlets to collect verbose information about the main components within a deployment. The tool also provides functionality to visualize the components within a network infrastructure using an interactive representation of the topology and the associations between the deployment&#39;s components.</p>

<p>Until a few months back, Argentina had a monarchy-styled government that
included huge corruption, nepotism, and political violence. N&eacute;stor
Kirchner was president for four years, then his wife, Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner, was president for the following eight years. Instead of giving press conferences, she used the official Twitter account (@CFKArgentina) to spread Goebbels-styled propaganda, send threats to the opposition, and exalt fanatics of all kinds.
This talk will explain the adaptation of an old chatter bot engine designed for
a porn web site that now is used for a fake presidential Twitter account. Day by
day, lots of political tweets are answered by this bot and almost no one detects
that a piece of code is responsible for the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#Steven Rambam">Steven Rambam</a></strong></p>
<p>First came the assault on privacy. Name, address, telephone, DOB, SSN, physical description, friends, family, likes, dislikes, habits, hobbies, beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, finances, every granular detail of a person&#39;s life, all logged, indexed, analyzed and cross-referenced. Then came the gathering of location and communication data. Cell phones, apps, metro cards, license plate readers and toll tags, credit card use, IP addresses and authenticated logins, tower info, router proximity, networked &quot;things&quot; everywhere reporting on activity and location, astoundingly accurate facial recognition mated with analytics and &quot;gigapixel&quot; cameras and, worst of all, mindlessly self-contributed posts, tweets, and &quot;check-ins,&quot; all constantly reporting a subject&#39;s location 24-7-365, to such a degree of accuracy that &quot;predictive profiling&quot; knows where you will likely be next Thursday afternoon. Today we are experiencing constant efforts to shred anonymity. Forensic linguistics, browser fingerprinting, lifestyle and behavior analysis, metadata of all types, HTML5, IPv6, and daily emerging &quot;advances&quot; in surveillance technologies - some seemingly science fiction but real - are combining to make constant, mobile identification and absolute loss of anonymity inevitable. And, now, predictably, the final efforts to homogenize: the &quot;siloing&quot; and Balkanization of the Internet. As Internet use becomes more and more self-restricted to a few large providers, as users increasingly never leave the single ecosystem of a Facebook or a Google, as the massive firehose of information on the Internet is &quot;curated&quot; and &quot;managed&quot; by persons who believe that they know best what news and opinions you should have available to read, see, and believe, the bias of a few will eventually determine what you believe. What is propaganda? What is truth? You simply won&#39;t know. In a tradition dating back to the first HOPE conference, for three full hours <a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#Steven Rambam">Steven Rambam</a> will detail the latest trends in privacy invasion and will demonstrate cutting-edge anonymity-shredding surveillance technologies. Drones will fly, a &quot;privacy victim&quot; will undergo digital proctology, a Q&amp;A period will be provided, and fun will be had by all.</p>

<p>Increasingly, as you navigate the web, your movements are being tracked. Even when you reject browser cookies, you transmit unique information that makes your browser personally identifiable. Ad tech and tracking companies are transforming the web into a platform where your user data is brokered and exchanged freely without your consent or even knowledge - and there is a true absence of limits to the methods trackers are willing to use to get that data from you. Luckily, there is hope. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has been developing technologies that let you know exactly how much of this data you are giving out as you browse, as well as releasing tools to help you protect yourselves against the trackers.

But protected rights like privacy and free speech already <em>are</em> security. Rights and security are not antithetical; they are compatible. Government power and corporate profits fuel the rights versus security narrative that has dominated the U.S. and Europe since the introduction of the U.S. Patriot Act. To dislodge this dominant narrative, this panel has developed over the course of two years a human rights respecting definition of cyber security and a normative statement of policy recommendations for how cyber security policy should be written and implemented if it is to truly be secure, e.g. to protect human rights.</p>

The bad news is that most vulnerable wallets were emptied a long time ago. The good news is that we get to look at how (and how fast) &quot;cryptocriminals&quot; operate in the process. In any case, new tools that implement some of the attacks will be demoed and released.

<p>The public switched telephone network has seen better days. With interest diverted to the Internet and mobile services, the venerable PSTN that we know and love seems like it&#39;s ready for the knackers. But maybe that&#39;s not quite right. True, the dominant carriers have let their wireline networks rot, and the TDM technology that seemed so advanced two decades ago is this year&#39;s black-and-white TV set. But the PSTN has undergone many rounds of evolution, from cord switchboards to Strowger dial to common control to analog ESS to digital. Now SIP signaling and IP networks are taking over. It&#39;s the big carriers who want to claim that this is no longer the PSTN so that they can get out of their regulatory obligations and exercise their remaining monopoly muscle. And the folks in Washington who are supposed to be supervising this still haven&#39;t figured out what VoIP is, so no wonder it&#39;s all such a mess. Let&#39;s see where the PSTN is going and what that means to us.</p>

<p>Pirate radio in New York City is a homegrown cultural phenomenon that is at once aesthetically vibrant, technologically tumultuous, and undeniably illegal. Emanating from clandestine studios and hidden transmitters, the sounds of Kreyol, Yiddish, Spanish, and Caribbean-accented English waft into the urban atmosphere. On an average night in Flatbush, Brooklyn, it&#39;s not uncommon to be able to hear as many as three dozen pirate stations between 87.9 and 107.9 Mhz. This flowering of outlaw micro-radio stations in Brooklyn and throughout the greater New York City region is a major disruption to the status quo of corporate controlled, robo-playlisted mega stations. Their unregulated presence and programming often reflects the throb and hum of a diverse city more authentically than traditional media outlets.

<p>This spring, the FCC&#39;s net neutrality rules were upheld in court, giving the commission license to regulate the Internet as a public utility and ensure that all users are treated fairly. However, the question remains as to exactly how net neutrality should be implemented and how well the concept applies to not only the Internet of today, but tomorrow. Panelists will discuss the tensions between applying the idea of net neutrality to the pragmatics of the Internet&#39;s operations and the very real social and policy consequences of such decisions. By combining and contrasting legal, activist, technical, journalistic, and academic perspectives, they will dig deep into the thoughts and aims behind net neutrality and derive a more nuanced and effective assessment of what is needed to create an Internet that works for everyone.

<p>Anyone can tell you something is true because they &quot;researched&quot; it. Evan will present some methods of performing historical research that stand up to challenges. Some of the methods are useful for social hacking, however the scope does not include any coding or technical subjects.</p>

<p>Humans are storytelling beings. From the moment the primordial ooze Mendelized itself into something like consciousness, we have been telling yarns: about the harvest, about the Gods, about the giant cats that wanted to eat us. But - for fuck&#39;s sake! - hackers are bad storytellers. Misunderstood by the media (and we&#39;re not even talking about the mainstream press!), ripped apart by their own peers, often incomprehensible and boring. But <em>whhhhyyyy???</em> What&#39;s going on in the hackersphere is probably shaping the future of our civilization. Narratology refers to both the theory and the study of narrative, and narrative structure and the ways that these affect our perception. You should come and listen, because it might save our movement - and more.</p>

<p>How are hackers portrayed in the media? What are the typical stereotypes? How does the hacking community feel about the term &quot;hacker,&quot; gender portrayals, and depictions in movies and television shows? This panel hopes to answer all of these questions and more!
Aunshul and Quinn were at HOPE X, talked to attendees then, and asked about their thoughts on the ways hackers were presented in the media. They are now back to share what they&#39;ve found and to get more of your thoughts! Expect lots of interaction, conversation, and (possibly) heckling.</p>

<p>In a GUI-dominated cyberspace, the blind user is prey. When a UX change can mean the difference between productivity and disenfranchisement, when an interstitial scareware alert is indistinguishable from a legitimate error dialog, and when security cannot be established because accessibility is left to the aftermarket, the frustrating onus upon a non-visual user exceeds the empowerment the sighted user takes for granted. This talk will shed light on some of these invisible &quot;gotchas.&quot;</p>

<p>Sam was accused of illegal hacking in the <em>SC Magazine</em> article &quot;Professor Hacks University Health Conway in Demonstration for Class.&quot; That article made a mess so big, it took a real lawyer, <a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#Alex Muentz">Alex Muentz</a>, to clear it up. Sam will explain how this happened and Alex will then explain how he handled this and offer informed advice on the laws around vulnerability disclosure, along with how to use the media effectively. In addition, Alex will describe a few other cases where attempts at responsible disclosure went wrong, what had to be done to fix it, and how the disclosure <em>should</em> have been done.</p>

<p>Governments have gotten really good at coming up with ways to undermine encryption. They can outright ban the use of certain types or strengths, place trade restrictions, mandate the insertion of backdoors or vulnerabilities, work with companies directly to undermine the encryption standards, arrest executives for failing to comply with orders, and seek assistance from courts through antiquated, off topic laws.
In this presentation, Amie and Drew will compare various approaches and provide the historical context that better illustrates how and why such restrictions are doomed to either fail or worsen the state of digital security. The session is planned to be part history lesson and part overview of the current state of encryption debates. The discussion will include where panelists think the law of encryption should and will go, and provide details on the campaigns that have been run at Access Now to promote the unrestricted use of encryption.</p>

<p>With 11 percent of the cyber security workforce being women, why is it important to encourage women to be involved? How is security done differently by women or is it? This panel consists of women in different phases of career: just graduated college starting first professional job, mid-career, and experienced professional. Each panel member will provide an overview of their perspective on the workplace, including if they have experienced discrimination, how best to survive and thrive, and when it is time to move on.
Attendees will learn how others have responded to specific incidents, managed work life balance, become aware of how they may be making the environment feel hostile, and dealt with potential legal implications of their actions, and will also learn why having a diverse employee pool is good for the organization and for fellow employees.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll never believe this one weird trick that lets you flip the script on mass surveillance. Oppressive institutions <em>hate</em> it. In this call to arms, we&#39;ll learn how to change up debates about secure software and fight calls for backdoors more persuasively, as well as develop a way of thinking about building and supporting tools which really serve people&#39;s security needs. The trick? Think (and talk) about journalists.</p>

Over the last six years, they have been using Little Big Planet to build and break custom game environments for live music performance. Joined by multidisciplinary technologist <a href="https://xi.hope.net/speakers.html#Jeremy Pesner">Jeremy Pesner</a>, they will demonstrate and take apart some of their stranger maps and virtual instruments like the Tiltofon, the Flotrillium, and the Anytime-inator, while discussing successes and failures arising from repurposing or pushing game level-building tools beyond intended uses. They will raise questions about hacking the &quot;look and feel&quot; of game spaces and how it relates to professional game development tools like Unity and the Unreal Engine versus off-the-shelf games like <em>Little Big Planet, Minecraft,</em> or <em>Portal.</em> They will also look at Machinima (using game engines to create cinema) as an early strategy of video game appropriation and its relationship to culture jamming and hard/soft hacking in the gaming community. Lastly, they will present a sneak peak of the upcoming musical-in-game-space, <em>Songs from the Robot Apocalypse,</em> featuring the Arachnobot, the flying Toasterbot, and a robot made from a classic Game Boy DMG-1.</p>
